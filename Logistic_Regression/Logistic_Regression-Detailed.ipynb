    "   - You might literally ask such a model to ‚Äògenerate‚Äô, i.e. draw, a dog\n",
    "   - Given a test image, the system then asks whether it‚Äôs the cat model or the dog model that better fits (is less surprised by) the image, and chooses that as its label.\n",
    "-  disciminative model\n",
    "   - only trying to learn to distinguish the classes\n",
    "   - So maybe all the dogs in the training data are wearing collars and the cats aren‚Äôt. If that one feature neatly separates the classes, the model is satisfied. If you ask such a model what it knows about cats all it can say is that they don‚Äôt wear collars. \n",
