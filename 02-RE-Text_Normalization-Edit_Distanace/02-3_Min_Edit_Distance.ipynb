    "  > Imagine some string (perhaps it is *exention*) that is in this optimal path (whatever it is). The intuition of dynamic programming is that if *exention* is in the optimal operation list, then the optimal sequence must also include the optimal path from *intention* to *exention*. Why? If there were a shorter path from *intention* to *exention*, then we could use it instead, resulting in a shorter overall path, and the optimal sequence wouldn’t be optimal, thus leading to a contradiction. \n",
