    "\n",
    "A stochastic process is said to be **stationary** if the probabilities it assigns to a sequence are *invariant* with respect to shifts in the time index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I.e., the probability distribution for words at time $t$ is the same as the probability distribution at time $t+1$.\n",
    "- Markov models, and hence n-grams, are stationary.\n",
    "  - E.g.,  in bigram, $P_i$ is dependent only on $P_{i-1}$. If we shift our time index by $x$, $P_{i+x}$ is still dependent on  $P_{i+x-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural language is NOT stationary\n",
    "  - the probability of upcoming words can be dependent on events that were arbitrarily distant and time dependent. \n",
